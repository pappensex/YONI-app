# pi² A–Z (Perfect)

This directory seeds the upcoming pi² A–Z space. It currently holds a placeholder README to anchor the folder in version control and to serve as the starting point for future content.

To initialize a new repository from this directory, run:

```bash
cd pi2_AZ_perfect
git init
git add .
git commit -m "pi² A–Z initial import"
git branch -M main
```

Those commands mirror the requested setup sequence and document how to reproduce the initial import locally.
