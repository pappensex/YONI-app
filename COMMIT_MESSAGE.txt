feat(ops): add Notion template and CI validation for launch management

Introduce comprehensive launch task management infrastructure with Notion
integration and automated CI validation to support the YONI app launch.

Files Added/Modified:

Launch Task Management (project-ops/launch/):
- notion-template.json: Structured task template for three strategic pillars
  (BUILD, PAYMENT, YOUTUBE) with 12 tasks, status tracking, and priorities
- tasks.csv: Flat CSV representation for external tool imports (Jira/Trello)
- README.md: Complete documentation with jq queries, CSV usage, and workflow

Deploy Control Center (core/modules/deploy-center/):
- notionFormulas.ts: Notion-style formula utilities (prop, round, format,
  toNumber, calculateSubtasksDone) for progress calculations
- notionFormulas.test.ts: Comprehensive test suite validating all formula
  functions with real-world percentage calculation examples
- README.md: Formula documentation with step-by-step execution examples
- YoniDeployControlCenter.tsx: React component integrating Notion formulas

CI/CD Infrastructure (.github/workflows/):
- main.yml: GitHub Actions workflow for automated build, test, and lint
  validation on pushes and PRs targeting main branch

Rationale:

1. Task Management: Provides structured approach to YONI launch with clear
   ownership across BUILD (technical), PAYMENT (monetization), and YOUTUBE
   (marketing) pillars. JSON format enables programmatic access, CSV ensures
   compatibility with existing project management tools.

2. Notion Integration: Implements Notion formula syntax
   (toNumber(format(round(prop())))) to maintain consistency between YONI
   Deploy Control Center and external Notion workspace, enabling seamless
   progress tracking across platforms.

3. CI Validation: Establishes automated quality gates for all code changes,
   running linter, tests, and build on every PR to prevent regressions and
   ensure code quality standards are maintained throughout launch sprint.

4. Documentation: Comprehensive README files provide quick-start guides, usage
   examples, and integration patterns, reducing onboarding friction for new
   contributors and ensuring knowledge continuity.

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for launch tasks across all platforms
- Automated validation reduces manual review overhead
- Formula utilities enable consistent progress calculations
- Flexible export formats (JSON/CSV) support diverse workflows
- Clear documentation accelerates team collaboration

BREAKING CHANGE: None - This is additive functionality only.
